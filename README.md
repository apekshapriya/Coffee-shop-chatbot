## Model

A simple rule based model


## How to run?
I have used Cmd2 package inorder to have an interactive session. Cmd2 uses "in" as its first input always. So while giving any input, first input should be "in".

Inplace of giving input as "hi" ,we need to give input as "in hi"
eg:

(cmd)in hi

bot:he,we welcome you

(cmd)in can I have coffee?

bot: yeah
 
Inorder to end a session and begin new test case ,we need to do control+z or control+d
